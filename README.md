# Scratch User Quality

This project evaluates the quality of Scratch projects and users based on various metrics.

## Features

- Fetches Scratch user projects from the Scratch API.
- Evaluates the quality of individual Scratch projects, using gpt-4o-mini.
- Calculates the overall quality of a Scratch user based on their top projects.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/khang200923/scratch_user_quality.git
    cd scratch_user_quality
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```

## Usage

Run the main script:
